<h3> and this is how our story starts... </h3>
<h3> It's a beautiful sunny day and you decide to take a walk. You decide to take a stroll down to the beach.
  As you walk you enjoy the fresh air, the warm feeling of the sun on your skin, the feeling of the wind in your hair.
  It's calming and you wonder why you ever stopped taking walks. You reach the boardwalk and suddenly stop in awe at the
  sight of of the ocean... </h3>

  <h1> Now do you... </h1>

  <button id = "one"> <h3> take your shoes off and go towards the ocean </h3> </button>

  <h1> OR... </h1>

  <button id ="two"> <h3> keep walking on the boardwalk </h3> </button>
