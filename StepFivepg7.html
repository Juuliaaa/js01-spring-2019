<h3>
  The girl squeals when you agree to having lunch with her. She smiles and grabs your hand
  and starts talking about how excited she is for senior year of high school, she keeps on talking
  a billion miles a minute that you zone out for a bit. She then stares at you "Okay enough about me, how are you doing?"
  You don't even know what to say at first, what is up with you? all you can think about is your boring daily
  routine and about you have literally no friends, your life is boring and you would rather spend time
  binge - watching Netflix shows than do anything else... what had your life become? Just a boring high schooler
  who does nothing and just complains about it, as well as does nothing to change it. You must have spaced out for quite
  a while 'cause you snap back and notice Shauna waving her hand in front of your eyes "Oh my God, are you okay?
  You kinda spaced out there for a bit" You look back at her and smile and say..
