  You take the box and swim to the edge, you open it and it's empty, it's just a
  plastic box that looks like a clam. You decide that it's trash so you throw it
  back into the ocean. You put your shoes back on and make your way home, the sun is setting
  you just hope you won't be late for dinner.
</h3>
