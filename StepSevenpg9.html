  "Yeah sorry I just got distracted. What were you saying?" you quickly respond.
  "Oh it's all fine. Don't worry about it. Anyways I was wondering if you wanted
  to grab some food at this Mexican food place off the boardwalk?" Shauna asks.
  You've never heard of it but you agree, it's time to try something new. You guys
  walk on the boardwalk a bit more and then finally get to the restaurant. You guys
  order some food and spend the whole time laughing and catching up. You are having
  a lot of fun, you seemed to forgot how fun it could be to spend so much time with
  another person. It's not all that bad... Once you guys finish your food you guys
  make your way back to the boardwalk there you guys run into a carnival and decide
  to play some games. You both suck at pretty much all of them but that doesn't stop
  you, finally at one of the games you win a stuffed animal; a small monkey. Never
  in your life have you been so excited to win something, it might be a small little
  thing that doesn't matter at all but it makes you happy. It's starting to get dark
  and you know that your parents will start worrying about you if you stay out any
  longer so you decide that it's time to say your goodbyes. <br>
  As you walk home you think about how much fun you had and how happy you were
  and how sad you are now that it's over. That is on your mind until sleep catches you.
