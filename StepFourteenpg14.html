<h3>
  You've never been more freaked out in literally your whole life. You look at Matthew
  "Sorry I can't do this... This is too much. I didn't want this" You start hyperventilating
  "I want to go home. My parents are probably worried about me. How do I leave?"
  Matthew looks at you with worry "I can send you back but once you leave you won't
  ever remember this place. You won't ever be able to return..." You think about it for
  a second but you come to the conclusion that he just made all that up so that he
  could kidnap and murder you "Yeah okay. I'm fine with that, just send me back"
  You are NOT taking any chances. "Okay" he responds.
</h3>

<h3>
  You wake up on the sand and are confused 'How did I end up here?'. Your clothes
  are wet, you notice your shoes a few feet away and decide that you don't care
  about what got you here all you want to do right now is go home and sleep in your
  warm bed. You get up and walk home. You arrive your house and jump in the shower.
  You put on your pajamas and snuggle up in your bed with your dog and laptop.
  This is the only place you want to be right now. Perfectly perfect.
