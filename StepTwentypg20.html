  You nod. You totally understand that this woman decided that leaving you with
  total strangers would be better for you. But can anyone ever really know that?
  But she seems like she feels bad enough so you decide to leave it. It's not worth
  getting mad at this complete stranger. You slowly let the words escape
  "I understand..." from your lips. It almost hurts to say but you do it. Somewhere
  in the depths of your mind you wonder if this was the reason you never clicked
  with your parents, or if this was the excuse for everything that is wrong with you.
  You know it's not possible but you can't stop yourself from going there. That's
  just how it is... <br>
  She looks at you and you realize that means you probably zoned out once again.
  "I have a very important question for you right now: you can decide to stay here
  and make a life for yourself here or decide to get back home and forget all about
  me and this place. Personally I would like you to stay here and get to know you
  but it's your life and it's your decision..." You are surprised and don't know
  how to respond...
