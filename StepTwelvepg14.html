<h3>
  You read somewhere that fighting the ocean currents is the worst thing that
  you could ever do. In your opinion this weird pulling feeling is just you stuck
  in a current, nothing more and nothing less. When you were younger anytime you
  were scared or worried your mind would make these impossible that made no sense
  whatsoever and were totally fiction but that doesn't mean that you didn't believe
  it, and all it did was make you more scared and never seemed to solve any sort of problem
  you were to face. So now you decided to try the calm way. You close your eyes
  and let your body float, you lay perfectly limp and still so that the ocean current
  can take you wherever it wants to go. You keep repeating to yourself that you'll
  be fine and this is just a current, and you'll float out to shore eventually.
  Before you know it your back hits sand. LAND. You made it to shore. It worked.
  You've never been happier. You laugh out loud with the biggest smile on your
  face than you've had in a while. You get up on your feet and walk the whole way home,
  the smile never leaving your face.
