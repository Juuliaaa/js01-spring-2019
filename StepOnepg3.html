  You slide your shoes off and pick them up. You walk into the the sand and feel the slightly
  wet sand in between your toes. You run down to the ocean and let the cold sea water cover your
  feet. You see something further floating in the water and you decide to make your way to it.
  You wade in further, you come closer and notice that it's a shimmery box. You lean in to grab it
  but it moves away. You chase after it, but every step closer you get it moves away another three.
