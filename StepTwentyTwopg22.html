  "This place honestly looks amazing and the best place to live but I just can't
  leave my family like that. I may hate them at times but would they even be my
  family if I didn't hate them? I need them just as they need me. I may seem like
  I can do anything 'cause I'm a big girl but I need them. Some nights I need my mom
  after a bad dream, and sometimes I need my dad to tell me it's okay after a bad date
  or a break - up. They are my people, my support system. You may have just told me
  that they are just some strangers that have no blood relation but that doesn't
  change the fact that they are my parents. They have been with me my whole life,
  they were there for all my firsts, they've handled me at my worst and at my best
  times, they've picked me up when I've been down, and never, never gave up on me
  no matter how hard it got. So no I can't just leave all that because I can."
  You start tearing up but quickly wipe your tears before they fall down your
  cheeks. You think you see a tear swell in Aprodite's eye but before you can get
  a better look she wipes her face. "I understand..." she finally responds.
  "Matthew please escort her back to the surface." and she walks out of the room.
  Matthew swims back with you back in absolute silence. When you guys reach the
  surface he hugs you. "What you said back there really moved me. I always didn't
  have the best relationship and I respect the decision you made and what you said.
  I know we don't even know each other but I'll miss you" He backs up and smiles.
  "Enjoy it up here" he winks, and swims back under. You let what you said and what
  he told you just sink in. You basically run home. You open the front door and
  hug both of your parents "I love you. Thank you for everything."<br>
  This is where you're meant to be.
