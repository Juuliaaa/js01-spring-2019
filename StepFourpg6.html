  You start to swim in the other direction, you enjoy being fully submerged
  in the cold water it's relaxing in a way. You stop and float on your back, you
  close your eyes and take a deep breath... then suddenly you feel something
  pulling on your ankle, it feels like a hand grabbing your ankle and trying it's
  hardest to drown you. You don't know what to do...
