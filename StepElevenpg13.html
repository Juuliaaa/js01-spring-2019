  <!-- add crashing waves sounds -->
<h3>
  You never liked the feeling in your stomach that you get when your falling, or
  when you go on roller coasters, and that's the exact feeling you have now and
  you absolutely hate it. You start to scream and flair your arms and legs, you are
  afraid that this is the moment where you die, you imagine the story about the girl
  who left her house to go take a walk and never came back. That freaks you out even more
  you start screaming and crying, not sure if anyone could hear you anyhow. You don't
  care if they hear you or not, you keep screaming until a wave fully covers you, filling your
  lungs with water. Your whole life flashes in front of your eyes at once, from memories
  when you couldn't walk yet to the last time you remember telling your mom you love her.
  You scream and kick, you remember reading somewhere that fighting the ocean currents
  is the worst thing you could EVER DO but it's too late now, you're going to die anyways.
  You open your eyes and take a big breath and stop moving, leaving your life in the hands
  of the Mighty Greek God of the Sea: Poseidon...
