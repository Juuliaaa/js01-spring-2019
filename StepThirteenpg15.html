<h3>
  Matthew starts in front of you with his "not" mermaid tail thing, you fail to
  catch up with him since you don't have a tail. He looks back at you and laughs
  "Sorry, I forgot you don't have one of these" he says pointing down at his shimmery tail.
  He grabs your hand and you feel your face get bright red, you instantly wonder if
  he noticed that? Can you see people blush under water? 'Ugh this has weird written
  all over it' you think to yourself. But then you notice that you guys are approaching
  a city but fully submerged under water. You thought things like this city were just
  things of fairy tales and fictional movies, but maybe you thought wrong. There are
  families living here, little kids playing on playgrounds chasing each other, there
  are grownups either swimming around using their tails or people in vehicles.
  "Welcome to Atlantix" Matthew's eyes light up when he talks about his city. What
  you find most fascinating about this city, is the coexistence of sea life and people,
  or are they human - fish hybrids? Whatever they are this city that they live in looks
  way more sophisticated and cooler than New York City ever will. You are so
  amazed you have no words. Matthew spends a couple minutes just looking at you, mesmerized
  by this place he lived for his whole life. You want to ask him so many questions
  like "How is there electricty down here?" "What are all these buildings built from?"
  "Are all these people like you..? Hybrids?" "How do these buildings stand?"
  "How long has this place been here?" "How did it come to be?" But you are so amazed
  that you have no words. Matthew grabs your arm and pulls you into the city through the main gates
  as you guys speed in between the cars you bump into rainbow fish and apologize to them right away.
  You feel people stare at you because you don't have a tail and probably look like you
  don't belong, you kind of hate it but then you look up and notice something else that amazes you.
  You almost feel like you don't want to ever go home. But then you think about home
  and wonder what time it is, if your parents are wondering where you went? Are you late?
