  You start swimming towards the shimmery box, fully invested in the idea of getting to
  it and seeing what's inside. Finally after a couple minutes you reach the box.
  You reach your arm and grab it, almost loosing your grip on it... you look at it,
  it's a small plastic clam down in your hand. Right as you lift the lid to open it
  something grabs your leg and starts pulling you down towards the bottom of the ocean.
  It is too deep for you to grasp an even foothold, quickly you shut the box and the
  pulling automatically stops. That definitely puzzles you... you open it again
  and the pulling starts again, you quickly shut the box quickly and don't
  know what to do now...

<button id = "experiment">
  <h3>
  Do you open it and see where the pulling will get you?

  Do you close the box and take it to the edge?
