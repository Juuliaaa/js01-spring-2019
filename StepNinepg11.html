<h3>
  You open the box and feel a hand grab both of your ankles and pull with all it's force,
  all you do is close your eyes, relax your eyes and let the hands pull you underwater
  and further deeper into the Earth. Your confused but you don't ever open your eyes,
  you tell yourself that it's just like a big drop on a rollercoaster, you'll be okay
  because telling yourself that it's going to be okay while being pulled into the
  Earth is perfectly believable.
</h3>

<h3>
  The pulling feeling stops and your feet are touching ground, your afraid to open
  them up almost expecting all of your worst fears to pop up at you at once.
  Instead you hear a male voice whisper into your ear "Don't be scared you can
  open your eyes. We won't hurt you." You open your eyes to a handsome muscular man
  standing in front of you. You get stuck on his piercing blue eyes, then you notice
  he doesn't have legs but a shiny tail. It startles you and he laughs "Oh this?
  Well you humans have legs, and we have tails we need to move somehow" You then realize
  that you can breathe down here. You are now very confused. "Okay. You might
  be wondering who I am, no I am not a mermaid I am a human - fish hybrid, it's
  a lot of science that I don't want to explain as well as you don't want to hear.
  The box you opened; that looked like a clam. It was a portal to our world 'Atlantix'
  the box is only visible to people like us, that means there is something in your family
  history that you don't know about, but we definitely do. Yes, you can breathe underwater
  as well as you can speak. No, we won't hurt you. And I don't know if you'll grow
  a tail. It matters how much time you spend here as well as your gene structure matters,
  more science that doesn't matter. Oh I'm Matthew by the way. Come I'll show you around"
