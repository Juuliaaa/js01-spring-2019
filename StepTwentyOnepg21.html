<h3>
  You like it here and decide that it would be interesting to pursue a life here.
  "Yes I would love to stay here. I don't have anything back on the 'Outside'
  anyways..." Matthew looks the most excited about the fact that you've decided to
  stay here. You're not even sure how you feel exactly...
</h3>

<h1>
  One Month Later...
</h1>

<h3>
  This has been the best month of your life... You and Matthew have been dating
  and you finally know what all those movies are made about, you finally belive
  in true love. You have a bunch of friends and even a friend group in your new
  high school. You're kind of the cool girl since your the one that actually spent
  most of your life on the 'Outside' and not just learning about it, also you're
  the only one without a tail so that gives you extra points. Sometimes you wonder
  about your parents but then you remember that life wasn't that great with them
  and forget that you were thinking about them in the first place. <br>
  Life is great. You have friends and people by your side. You are happy. That's
  all that matters.
