 <h3>
  You keep walking along the boardwalk admiring the ocean from a distance... After a while
  you hear someone calling your name <p><span> </span> </p>! "Oh my God <p> <span> </span> </p> I haven't seen you in FOREVER.
  How are you? Oh my God we totally have to catch up. Come with me let's grab some lunch and hang a bit!"
  This girl who you vaguely remember is talking a mile a minute. You kind of dont want to 'catch up' with
  this strangely annoying girl but you also don't want to hurt her feelings
