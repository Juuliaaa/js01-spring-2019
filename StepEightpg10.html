  "Yeah. Sorry I was just thinking maybe we should go to that new Chipotle off the
  boardwalk" you quickly tell her. She smiles "Yes of course. That sounds like a great
  idea." You guys keep walking down the boardwalk, talking the whole time you're actually
  having a good time. You guys reach the Chipotle and bump into some friends from school.
  You remember them, Shauna notices them and waves at them and before you know it all of
  you guys are sitting together eating and laughing as if you were all the bestest of friends
  for the longest time. Once you guys all finish you decide to hang out some more.
  You guys go down to the park and crack jokes and just let time pass doing nothing,
  and that's the best way to spend time, especially in a group of friends. Before any
  of you know it gets dark and you all have to go your seperate ways... You all say
  your goodbyes knowing well that you most likely won't ever talk to one another again.
