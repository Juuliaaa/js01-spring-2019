  You look at her sitting on her throne looking so powerful. You're a bit interested
  how this woman knows you but you decide to decline hearing her explanation. You
  don't think it's even worth your time. "I'm sorry but I don't want to hear it.
  I know you say it would be better for me but honestly the only reason you're willing
  to tell me is to get off whatever secret off of your chest, and I don't want to
  make you feel better about yourself in any way. I want you to enjoy the rest of
  your life and I would like to get back to mine." You look back to Matthew and he nods.
  He puts his hand on the small of your back and he leads you out of the building and
  back up to the surface. His look is sad but you guys both know that this has to
  be done. "Goodbye Shauna" he hugs you and disappears underwater once again.
  You look at the ocean positive that it was all a dream but you know it wasn't...
  The sun is beginning to set when you walk home. This was definitely a crazy day...
