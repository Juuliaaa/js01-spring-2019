  You feel bad but the whole reason why you went out for this walk was to clear your mind
  and not spend time with some time where you would feel like you were walking around
  eggshells while talking to her. Today was supposed to be a YOU day, the day where you
  relax and forget about everything else going wrong in your life. You kind of want to go
  back and apologize to her, but then you think about it and decide that she's not worth it
  and you decide to go home the long way.
