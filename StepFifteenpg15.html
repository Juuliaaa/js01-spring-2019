<h3>
  You're underwater in a city with people you don't know and you're amazed but
  also scared. Youd don't know what time it is so you decide that you have to
  go back. You know you're prone to panic attacks so you start taking deep breaths.
  Matthew notices that something is off. He takes your hand and pulls you to the side.
  "What's wrong?" You are not able to let words escape your mouth, just breaths barely
  able to make it to your lungs. He quickly takes you up to the surface, and there
  is when you can finally fill your lungs with fresh air. "What happened down there?
  You have a panic attack?" You nod "I have them a lot. I make these situations in my
  head that just make whatever thing I'm thinking about way worse and more frightening
  for me..." He nods and seems to understand. "It was a lot to see at once, so if you
  want to think about it before we go back you can go home and spend however long you
  want to think about if you even want to return." You are relieved, you hug him
  "Thank you; really." You walk out of the ocean and home, dazed not knowing what
  to do now...
