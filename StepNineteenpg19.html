  "That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Was running this city really more
  important than me? Your OWN child??! You weren't even sure if I would get a good
  family I could have been stuck in the foster system 'till this day. Would you come
  for me if I was? Honestly was sitting down here in your throne better than being
  able to take care of me? You could have even rebeled against your father and brought
  me here but no I'm not good enough. I never have been and never will be." hot
  tears start rolling down your cheeks, is this why you've felt so off and weird?
  Is this the piece that you were missing all these years? Your own mother who
  decided that her own life was worth protecting than yours? Who is this woman?
  Who does she think she is. You storm out of the room, not knowing where you're
  going you just keep going until you start running (at least attempting to, it's
  hard to run underwater) You don't where you are or how long you have been running
  but you stop to catch your breath. Matthew catches up to "Dang you're fast. Can
  I join you?" You want to be mad at him and ignore him but you remember that not
  did he not do anything to you he is the only person that you know here, and the only
  one that can help you get back. "Yeah sure." you respond. "I really want to go home
  after all this. Can you take me back?" you ask him. "Of course." he responds with
  a smile.

<h3>
  You don't know how and when but you wake up in the sand at the edge of the beach.
  You're definetly confused but you still remember clearly what happened and
  where you just were, but that's not something you want to think about. You brush
  off your jeans and start walking along the ocean until the sun completely sets and
  it gets dark.
