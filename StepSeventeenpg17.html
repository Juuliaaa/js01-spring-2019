  She starts speaking and right away you can sense how theatrical she is. Almost
  as if she was taught to speak in a calm sort of way, you don't know what it is
  but it puts you off. "A long time ago, when I turned 21 I had the choice of being
  able to visit the 'Outside' there I feel in love with a human and one thing led to
  another and we made you. But when he found out what I was he didn't want anything
  to do with me or you. He was a terrible person, but when my father had found out
  he told me to either choose you and have a life on the 'Outside' and never come back
  or leave you and come here and rule 'Atlantix' so I chose 'Atlantix'. That might make
  me a terrible person but I did what I thought was right. I knew if we stayed our life
  wouldn't be amazing and I knew that you would be put with a better family. So
  I said goodbye, filled out the paperwork and returned home."
