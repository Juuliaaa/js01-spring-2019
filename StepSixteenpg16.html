  You have telling Matthew about returning home on the tip of your tongue, but then
  you bump into a girl and her friends swimming through the streets, laughing and
  smililing. She rolls her eyes at you but then notices Matthew and you notice
  her face light up with joy. She swims up behind him and whispers something in his
  ear that you don't hear, you see his cheeks flush with a rosy color (people do blush
  down here... good to know) He spins around and kisses her right on her lips, you
  watch their hands travel each other's bodies. Something about that makes you
  jealous, it's not like he was yours or anything, you barely know him... After
  a couple minutes or so they finally part from their embrace "This is Lily"
  Matthew tells me gesturing to the girl he just spent exchanging saliva with.
  You nod at her "Hey, I'm Shauna" Lily gestures to the guys behind her "These
  are my friends: Hunter and Roland" They both look at you with interest, almost a
  sort of hunger. Matthew looks at you "Yeah, so this is Shauna she's from the
  Outside" that makes them look more interested. "Ohhh this is the girl they're
  talking about..." Hunter says with a smirk. "Wait what does that mean?" you ask...
  "Talking about?" Matthew looks worried like as if a secret he's been keeping has just
  came out "Yeah. You didn't find the portal by accident... We've been watching you for
  a while and thought that it was finally time for you to come down and visit where
  you're actually from. To find your people." All these thoughts enter your mind.
  'Is this history why I've never been able to find good friends?' 'Is this why
  I don't have an interest in doing anything other than take showers and sleep?'
  Matthew touches your shoulder "I'm sorry. I know this is a lot but I still have
  more that I need to show you." We leave Lily, Hunter and Roland behind and keep
  whizzing through this beautiful city. We finally arrive at our destination.
  It is a big building that looks as if it would be entirely built out of glass.
  It looks so tall, that you're amazed it doesn't stick out of the ocean. You guys
  go through the doors and the building is filled with water as well. You guys swim up
  to the security guard. He seems to notice who you are and lets you guys past with no questions.
  You guys enter an elevator and take it to the very last floor. You guys enter a big room
  and inside there's a woman sitting on a big gold chair wearing a crown. She looks at you
  and a mixture of sadness and excitment take over her expression. Matthew opens his mouth
  to begin introductions, but the woman puts her hand up and stops him. "Hello Shauna.
  My name is Amphitrite, goddess of the Sea, and ruler of Atlantix. I know you have a lot
  of questions, and trust we'll get to that point but first I would like to tell you how I know
  who you are. May I?"
